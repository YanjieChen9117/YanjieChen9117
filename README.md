## 🔧 Skills
- **Languages**: R, Python, MATLAB, LaTeX
- **Techniques**: Bayesian Inference · ABC‑SMC · Random Forests · Time Series Analysis
  
## 📚 Selected Projects

### 🧬 DECODE · Tumor Subclone Reconstruction *(private, code release soon)*
Packaged a full Bayesian pipeline that recovers tumor evolutionary parameters from SFS data. Integrated ABC‑SMC with Distributional Random Forests and matched community benchmarking standards. Complete algorithm frozen; pipeline repository will be open‑sourced after documentation is finalized.

### 🧠 Azure Partners · AI Teaching Assistant *(outputs only)*
Designed and delivered a deep‑learning curriculum (PyTorch/TensorFlow) covering CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and object detection. Produced graded assignments, demo notebooks, and slide decks; company policy restricts code release, but example model outputs and visualizations are showcased below.

### 📈 Consumer Behaviour Shift Analysis — The Very Group & University of Liverpool
Collaborated with The Very Group to quantify post‑crisis shifts in customer spending. Built seasonal ARIMA models to derive theoretical spend curves and detected > 20 % deviation. Identified that *casual credit* users were most affected and that “buy now, pay later” reached a 49.3 % popularity rate. Full PDF report and fit diagnostics available on request.

### 🍺 Alcohol Duty Impact Forecast — HM Revenue & Customs
Modelled UK alcohol consumption by beverage class under new duty bands. Used multivariate time‑series forecasting to estimate volume changes and incremental tax revenue. Findings inform policy scenarios for optimizing public health and an estimated £64.9 B revenue stream. Detailed report available upon request.
